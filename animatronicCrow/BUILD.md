| 2   | 5mm Red LEDs             | For the eyes. I am using frosted.                                                                                              |
| 1   | SG90 5v Servo            |                                                                                                                                |
| 1   | 28BYJ-48 5v Stepper      | If using CC5x12 stepper control you do not need the breakout board (though you could transfer those components to the CC5x12). |
| 1   | 40mm 4Ω, 3w Speaker      | 8Ω will work.                                                                                                                  |
| 1   | Micro SD Card            | For the mp3 audio files.                                                                                                       |
| 1   | HC-SR312 AM312 Mini PIR  | Optional. Human motion sensor. *Testing the LD1020 radar sensor soon*                                                          |
| 3   | Wires/Connectors         | Two 2-wire and one 3-wire for the speaker, LEDs, and PIR. CC5X12 uses standard 2.54mm pin headers (or could be soldered directly). |
| 1   | Large Paperclip          | ~1.25mm thick.                                                                                                                 |
| 1   | 2mm Rod                  | About 15mm long for the beak hinge. I'm using carbon fiber, but any material should work.                                      |
| 9   | M3x4x5 Heat Melt Inserts | 5mm tall (M3x5x5) inserts will also fit.                                                                                       |
| 11  | M3 screws                | 5 x 8mm for the head and tail, 4 x 6mm for the stepper and PCB, 2 x 5mm countersunk for the body (or regular 6mm should work). |
| 2   | M3 nuts                  | For the stepper mount collar in the head.                                                                                      |
| 8   | 10 x 3mm magnets         | Neodymium high strength magnets for attaching tail to body.                                                                    |
|     | Hot Glue                 | Black preferred.                                                                                                               |
|     | Polyfill                 | Just a little for sound dampening in the speaker housing.                                                                      |

### [Creature Control 5x12](../creatureControl/README.md) ###
Note that the CC5x12 board will not be fully filled for this project.
CC5x12 provides multiple options for powering the 5v rail.
***You must only ever connect one of them at a time***.
The RP2040-Zero can be plugged into power (including your computer) while the 5v rail is also receiving power.

| ![LEDs for crow eyes](images/AniCrow017.jpg)                                                                             | Begin by assembling the LEDs. The resistor will be on the board, so you just wire them in parallel. I'm using a 2-wire connector from which I've cut the end and stripped the wires, plus a couple small pieces of high-temp wire and some heat shrink tubing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Soldered LEDs for crow eyes](images/AniCrow016.jpg)                                                                    | Solder the LEDs together "stacked," putting the positive and negative leads together with the positive or negative wire. Cover all exposed wiring with heat shrink tubing or electrical tape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ![Crow LED eyes test](images/AniCrow015.jpg)                                                                             | Before assembling, test with test-servo.ino script loaded onto your CC5x12 board. Both lights should light and blink every 4 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Adjust the depth to an aesthetic level (don't push them all the way in.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Leave it to cool completely with everything in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Cut it just longer than the support and round over the ends. It's a little easier to press it through from the right side. Be careful not to bend the tower tabs as they are somewhat delicate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The ends should be 15 and 10mm and bent into as sharp a 90 as possible. The middle third of the run should have a ~45 degree bend and the two ends should be 30mm apart. See the image for the correct shape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

It may require a little scraping and twisting. The fit is tight, but you want it as close as possible to the 90 bend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If all has gone well, the beak will be opening and closing fully.<br/><br/> * If you hear the servo making a clicking or grinding sound when open, you can either loosen the bend in the actuator or adjust the servo arm connection.<br/> * If the beak doesn't open completely you can tighten up the actuator bend or adjust the servo arm connection.<br/><br/>Adjust the `beakCloseDeg` and re-upload until the beak fully opens and closes without grinding noises. About 0 and 60 degrees. Small changes matter. |
