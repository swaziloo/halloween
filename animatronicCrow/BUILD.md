| 2   | 5mm Red LEDs                    | For the eyes. I am using frosted.                                                                                                               |
| 1   | SG90 5v Servo                   | MG90S also works.                                                                                                                               |
| 1   | 28BYJ-48 5v Stepper             | If using CC5x12 stepper control you do not need the breakout board (though you could transfer those components to the CC5x12).                  |
| 1   | 40mm 4Ω, 3w Speaker             | 8Ω will work. Consider a waterproof speaker if the crow will be left outdoors. A paper cone speaker is the weakest component in wet conditions. |
| 3   | M2.6 x 8mm tapping screws       | For attaching the speaker flange.
| 1   | Micro SD Card                   | For the mp3 audio files.                                                                                                                        |
| 1   | HC-SR312 AM312 Mini PIR         | Optional. Human motion (directional) sensor.                                                                                                    |
| 1   | 8006 Fresnel Lens (Black)       | Optional. Small lens replacement for the Mini PIR sensor. 
| 1   | HLK-LD1020 10G Radar Sensor     | Optional. Radar movement (non-directional) sensor.                                                                                              |
| 3   | Wires/Connectors                | Two 2-wire and one 3-wire for the speaker, LEDs, and PIR. CC5X12 uses standard 2.54mm pin headers (or could be soldered directly).              |
| 1   | Large Paperclip                 | ~1.25mm thick.                                                                                                                                  |
| 1   | 2mm Rod                         | About 15mm long for the beak hinge. I'm using carbon fiber, but any material should work.                                                       |
| 9   | M3x4x5 Heat Melt Inserts        | 5mm tall (M3x5x5) inserts will also fit.                                                                                                        |
| 11  | M3 screws                       | 5 x 8mm for the head and tail, 4 x 6mm for the stepper and PCB, 2 x 5mm countersunk for the body (or regular 6mm should work).                  |
| 2   | M3 nuts                         | For the stepper mount collar in the head.                                                                                                       |
| 8   | 10 x 3mm magnets                | Neodymium high strength magnets for attaching tail to body.                                                                                     |
|     | Cyanoacrylate (CA) and/or Epoxy | To attach the feet, magnets, and PIR window.                                                                                                    |
|     | Hot Glue                        | For sealing the speaker wire (and optionally, the speaker).                                                                                     |
|     | Polyfill                        | Just a little for sound dampening in the speaker housing.                                                                                       |

### [Creature Control 5x12](../creatureControl/README.md) ###
Note that the CC5x12 board will not be fully filled for this project.
CC5x12 provides multiple options for powering the 5v rail.
***You must only ever connect one of them at a time***.
The RP2040-Zero can be plugged into power (including your computer) while the 5v rail is also receiving power.

The resistor will be on the board, so you just wire them in parallel. I'm using a 2-wire connector from which I've cut the end and stripped the wires, plus a couple small pieces of high-temp wire and some heat shrink tubing.                                                                                                                                                         |

| ![PIR sensor with dark lens](images/AniCrow083.jpg)                  | **1c: PIR Sensor with Black Fresnel (my preferred)**<br/><br/>Take care gluing the plug into the knee. I prefer epoxy for this, but either glue needs to be managed with care to prevent damage to the finish.                                                                                                               |
| ![Prepare the PIR sensor](images/AniCrow048.jpg)                     | **2a: PIR Sensor with Standard Fresnel**<br/><br/>*The sensor is optional*<br/>It's better to print the PIR sensor mount face-down with a 0.2mm nozzle.<br/><br/>There is not much room for the wires, so either install the header vertically or bend it like I have (a risky maneuver). Add some hot glue to ensure things don't shake loose. |
| ![Prepare the Radar sensor](images/AniCrow070.jpg)                   | **3a: Radar Sensor**<br/><br/>*The sensor is optional*<br/>It's better to print the radar sensor mount face-down with a 0.2mm nozzle.<br/><br/>There is not much room for the wires, so I've used a 90-degree pin header. Add some hot glue to ensure things don't shake loose.                                              |
| ![Install the sensor](images/AniCrow049.jpg)                         | **2b & 3B PIR: Sensor with Standard Fresnel *or* Radar Sensor:** Installing the sensor is fiddly and requires slightly flexing the holder. Practice ahead of time with the empty holder. To remove the holder, grab the little column (green arrow here) with a pair of pliers and lift it upwards.                          |
| ![Install the "Try Me" Button](images/AniCrow084.jpg)                | **4a: "Try Me" Button**<br/><br/>*Optional*<br/>To utilize the pushbutton feature, attach a two-pin button (either NO or NC) to the SNSR1 GND and GP15 pins (connect nothing to the 3V3 pin). Route the wire out through the hole behind the left leg or tail.                                                               |
| ![Attach the head](images/AniCrow039.jpg)                            | Install the head on the stepper and use a piece of card stock to "shim" the top edge (green arrow). Using a 2mm hex wrench through the access holes on either side, tighten each while alternating: first just snug each, then tighten firmly.                                                                               |
| ![Ready for PCB](images/AniCrow052.jpg)                              | At this point you should have all the wires hanging out the back of the body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ![Install the mount rail on the PCCB](images/AniCrow053.jpg)         | Attach the mounting rail to the PCB with M3x6 screws. Clip any long leads that stick through the PCB under or near the mounting rail.<br/><br/>*Copy MP3 files to the SD card, as it will require disconnecting the PCB to get to it later.*                                                                                 |
| ![Flip onto it's back](images/AniCrow060.jpg)                        | Flip the crow over onto its back. Set it on a t-shirt or soft cloth to prevent scratches.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![Attach servo, speaker, and LED connections](images/AniCrow059.jpg) | Connect the LED, speaker, and servo leads. Pay attention to polarity (servo brown is GND).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ![Attach stepper and sensor](images/AniCrow058.jpg)                  | Slide the board partway into the body and connect the stepper and sensor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Software ##
Copy the [mp3](mp3) folder to your SD card.

Install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) and the following libraries:
[AccelStepper](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/AccelStepper),
[DFRobotDFPlayerMini](https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobotDFPlayerMini),
[arduino-pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) by Earle Philhower,
[Adafruit NeoPixel](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel). 
All of these should be installable from the library manager once in the Arduino IDE.

Enable the *Waveshare RP2040-Zero* board in the board manager.

Connect your RP2040-Zero to your PC, select the connected device, and assign the Waveshare RP2040-Zero board. 
Open the desired sketch and select 'Upload.'

### Sketches ###
*Note that Arduino expects the animations.h file to be in the same folder as the animatrnoic-crow or test-animations sketches.*
* [animatronic-crow](ino/animatronic-cros): The main software for your bird. You'll need to know the volume, stepper speed, and beak closed degrees so you can configure this for your particular crow. When connected to a PC, debug messages are sent to the Arduino Serial Monitor.
  * __TEST_MODE__ when set to true will illuminate the eyes whenever the sensor senses movement. Helpful for adjusting timeouts.
  * __SENSOR_MODE__ set to one of the following values:
    * __SENSOR_MODE_PIR__ will scold when it detects motion.
    * __SENSOR_MODE_LD1020__ will scold when it detects motion but block the sensor from detecting the crow's idle movements and squawks.
    * __SENSOR_MODE_BUTTON__ enables a "Try Me" pushbutton feature. The crow will wake up, scold, turn its head, squawk, and go back to sleep whenever the button is pressed. Button presses while the sequence is running will have no effect.
    * __SENSOR_MODE_NONE__ with no sensor, or when you prefer the full set of random scold and squawk animations.
  * __DFPLAYER_VOLUME__ hypothetical max 30, but actual max depends on power supply, speaker, etc. It's best to test (with test-animations and on battery power if that's how you intend to use it) and if sound drops out, lower until it doesn't.
  * __LD1020_ANIMATION_COOLDOWN_MS__ is your main "how reactive do I want this crow to be?" setting when using radar.
  * __SCOLD_SQUAWK_BLOCK_MS__ is your main "how reactive do I want this crow to be?" setting when using PIR.
  * __IDLE*__ settings control how active a non-reacting crow will be.
  * __BLINK*__ controls frequency of blinking.
  * __NECK*__ don't change the range, but adjust the fast speed if needed after testing with test-stepper.
  * __PIN__ definitions change if you aren't using the CC5x12 sensor1, servo1, stepper1, or led1.
* [test-animations](ino/test-animations): Confirm sound, test volume, and review animations. Play scolds and squawks and set volume on the Arduino Serial Monitor.
* [test-sensor](ino/tes-sensor): Simple sketch that illuminates the eyes when the sensor senses. Helps one understand/visualize sensor sensitivity.
* [test-servo](ino/test-servo): Reset the servo to zero->half->full->zero->etc. every four seconds. Necessary for determining the beak closed setting. Details on the serial monitor. Eyes blink for each movement.
* [test-stepper](ino/test-stepper): Runs through various tests to help you determine the max speed and acceleration for your stepper (neck). Details on the Serial Monitor.
