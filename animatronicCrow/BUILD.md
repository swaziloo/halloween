The resistor will be on the board, so you just wire them in parallel. I'm using a 2-wire connector from which I've cut the end and stripped the wires, plus a couple small pieces of high-temp wire and some heat shrink tubing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Cut it just longer than the support and round over the ends. It's a little easier to press it through from the right side. Be careful not to bend the tower tabs as they are somewhat delicate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

While holding the beak, slide the arm over the servo with a tiny bit of slack in the connection. Don't install the screw just yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [![Validate the ranges in software](images/AniCrow020.png)](https://youtube.com/shorts/lqEB10gqAUw) (YouTube video link) | Connect the servo mount plate to the head with a couple M3 screws and reconnect the CC5x12. If all has gone well, the beak will be opening and closing fully.<br/><br/> * If you hear the servo making a clicking or grinding sound when open, you can either loosen the bend in the actuator or adjust the servo arm connection.<br/> * If the beak doesn't open completely you can tighten up the actuator bend or adjust the servo arm connection.<br/><br/>Adjust the `beakCloseDeg` and re-upload until the beak fully opens and closes without grinding noises. About 0 and 60 degrees. Small changes matter. |

Drop two M3 nuts into the slots and install two 8mm M3 screws by fitting the hex wrench through the access holes until they will just touch the stepper pin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Stack the parts and join them with two M3 8mm screws.
