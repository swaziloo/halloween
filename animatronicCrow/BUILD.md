The resistor will be on the board, so you just wire them in parallel. I'm using a 2-wire connector from which I've cut the end and stripped the wires, plus a couple small pieces of high-temp wire and some heat shrink tubing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Cut it just longer than the support and round over the ends. It's a little easier to press it through from the right side.

The two ends should be about 10mm and bent into as sharp a 90 as possible. The middle third of the run should have a ~45 degree bend and the two ends should be 22mm apart.

Press hard (with pliers) to ensure it's as close as possible to the 90-degree bend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Connect power to the 5v rail and the usb to your PC. Load the test-servo.ino script (if you haven't already) and switch to the Serial Monitor. You should hear the servo reset and then start through a sequence. Watch the sequence in the monitor and disconnect the power when the servo is at the '0' position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

While holding the beak, slide the arm over the servo while ensuring there is as little slack as possible in the connection. Don't install the screw yet. (Note that this image shows an older mount tower. The approach is the same with the latest files.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [![Validate the ranges in software](images/AniCrow020.png)](https://youtube.com/shorts/lqEB10gqAUw) (YouTube video link) | Connect the servo mount plate to the head with a couple M3 screws and reconnect the CC5x12. If all has gone well, the beak will be opening fully and closing partially.<br/><br/> * If you hear the servo making a grinding sound when open, you can either loosen the bend in the actuator, adjust the servo arm connection, or change the "closed" number in the script.<br/> * If the beak doesn't open completely you can tighten up the actuator bend or adjust the servo arm connection.<br/><br/>Adjust the mid and open numbers and re-upload until the beak fully opens and closes without grinding noises. For the head in this video I ended up with 2, 35, and 59. Small changes matter. |

Stack the parts and join them with two M3 8mm screws. Your crow head is ready to go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
