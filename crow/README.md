# Animatronic Crow
Based on  designs from Thingiverse:
[Animatronic Halloween Crow by andymcculloch](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6278223)
and [Animatronic Halloween Crow by Doctor_JohnSmith](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6258153)
which are themselves remixes from [danman](https://www.thingiverse.com/danman/designs)
who remixed the original model by [YahooJAPAN](https://www.thingiverse.com/yahoojapan/designs).

My work has been done in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/), 
[FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/),
and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-4/).

Crow audio lifted from [DanCrow's Nest](https://dancrow.com).

This is presently a quick share of files I modified for building my version of andymcculloch's Animatronic Halloween Crow, [posted here](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:1216843).

I plan to update and organize and include original KiCad, FreeCAD, and Blender files.
Please reach out if I haven't yet and you want them.
